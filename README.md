Detect Safe Driving through the use of Data Analytics

Given the telematics data for each trip and the label if the trip is tagged as dangerous driving, derive a model that can detect dangerous driving trips.

The given dataset contains telematics data during trips (bookingID). Each trip will be assigned with label 1 or 0 in a separate label file to indicate dangerous driving. Pls take note that dangerous drivings are labelled per trip, while each trip could contain thousands of telematics data points. participants are supposed to create the features based on the telematics data before training models.
